# work-day-scheduler
In this challenge I had to create a work day scheduler. This schedule incorporates dayjs, as well as using Jquery to add event listeners and to manipulate the HTML. Additionally I used local storage so that the user can save tasks in their diary and then come back to them later. I also included a color scheme so that red shows you the present hour, grey is hours passed and green shows that they are in the future. Additionally I added a clear schedule button/
